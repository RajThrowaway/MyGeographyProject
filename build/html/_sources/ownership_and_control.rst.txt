Ownership and Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On Antarctica, there have been claims made by 7 countries, however most Antarctic territory is
unclaimed. The countries which claim portions of Antarctica are:

*  Argentina, supposedly claimed in 1493
*  Australia, claimed in 1933
*  Chile, claimed in 1940
*  France, claimed in 1840
*  New Zealand, claimed in 1923
*  Norway, claimed in both 1929 and 1939
*  United Kingdom, claimed in 1908

Overlapping claims include:

* The United Kingdom and Argentina
* Argnetina, Chile and the United Kingdom
* Chile and the United Kingdom

Countries tend  to place their research facilities within their own claims, however some have
facilities located within other countries' portions, and countries who do not even make claims to
Antarctica, such as Russia and the United States, have placed their research facilities within
other countries' claims.

On December 1st 1959, the Antarctic Treaty and other agreements, known
collectively as the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS), became open for signature with the purpose of
regulating relations and activity with respect to Antarctica. It established that Antarctica was a
scientific preserve, and that countries had the freedom to conduct scientific investigation and
research on Antarctica.

Moreover, it banned any military activity on Antarctica, making it the
first arms control agreement established during the Cold War. The Treaty has been signed by over 48
countries since, including the United Kingdom, United States, and the now dissolved Soviet Union
(succeeded by Russia). When a country signs the treaty, it is stated that any previous claims made
by that country have not been renounced, and that the basis of their claims is not to be affected
by signing the treaty.

Furthermore, it does not require signatory countries to recognise the claims
of other signatory countries. However, the treaty does affect new claims; it states that no
activites occuring after the declaration of the treaty can be the basis of a claim. No new claims
can be made once the treaty becomes effective, and any existing claims cannot be enlarged.

However,
the United States and the Soviet Union filed reservations against the restrictions on new claims.
Therefore, the United States and Russia assert the right to make claims in the future if they so
choose, leading some to speculate that they may do so in the coming future. The treaty became
effective June 23rd 1961.
