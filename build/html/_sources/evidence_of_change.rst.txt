Evidence of Change
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Antarctica has been experiencing air temperature increases of 3°C in the Antarctic Peninsula, which
is 5 times the mean rate of global warming according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC).

Therefore, over the past 50 years, the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula has been one of the
most rapidly warming places on the entire Earth. Not only has this warming been restricted to
Antarctica's land, but also the Southern Ocean, which surrounds Antarctica. Since 1955, upper ocean
temperatures to the west of the Antarctic Peninsula have increased by over 1°C. Furthermore, it has
since been established that the Antarctic Circumpolar Current has been warming much more quickly
than global oceans as a whole.

Moreover, scientists have established that the winds of Antarctica play a crucial role in dictating
the temperature of Antarctica as a whole. In the 1920s, the winds were consistenly cold, and
changed between cold and extremely cold. However, since then the baseline has moved up, meaning
that the winds have either been warm or cold due to the gradual warming of the Earth.
