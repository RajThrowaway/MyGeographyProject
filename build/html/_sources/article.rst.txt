Antarctica is the Earth's southernmost continents. It encapsulates the geographic South Pole, and
lies almost entirely south of the Antarctic circle. Antarctica is over 10,000 miles away from the
UK at its shortest, therefore it will take almost 19 hours by plane (with an average speed of 560
miles per hour) to reach Antarctica, if taking the shortest possible distance. In terms of size,
it is the fifth largest continent, with an area of 5.5 million square miles or 14.2 million
kilometres, this means that it is nearly twice the size of Antarctica. However, it is by far the
least densely populated continent with a mere 0.00008 people per square kilometre. This is due to
the fact that Antarctica does not have a permanent population, but rather permanent manned research
stations that are maintained by governments occupying Antarctic territories. Therefore, population
increases, by natural means, are very rare, with only 11 children born on the continent. In Winter,
there are approximately 1,000 people living in Antarctica, and this reaches about 5,000 in Summer.
Almost all (98%) of Antarctica is covered in extremely deep ice and snow, averaging 1.9 kilometres
in thickness, indicating that Antarctica has a very cold climate. Along with this, it is the
driest, with an annual precipitation of approximately 200 millimetres (less than the Sahara Desert)
however, this is far less, further inland, with there having been no rain for nearly 2 million,
therefore most of Antarctica is what is known as a 'Polar Desert', and the windiest (with a highest
recorded wind speed of almost 200 miles per hour). Moreover, Antarctica
